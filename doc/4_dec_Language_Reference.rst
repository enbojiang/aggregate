This section describes how a DecL program is pre-processed, lexed, and parsed according to the grammar specification. It reports the results of interpreting the builtin test suite of programs.

The DecL :ref:`introduction <design and purpose>` describes its design and purpose.

Pre-Processing
==============

Programs are processed one line at a time. Before passing to the lexer, the following pre-processing occurs.

1. Remove Python and C++ style  ``#`` or ``//`` comments, through end of line
2. Remove \\n in [ ] (vectors) that appear from  using ``f'{np.linspace(...)}'``
3. Map semicolons to newline
4. Map backslash newline (Python line continuations) to space
5. Replace \\n\\t  with space, to support the tabbed indented Portfolio layout
6. Split on remaining newlines

Lexer Term Definitions
======================

Ignored characters: tab (remaining after pre-processing), colon, comma, and pipe. These characters can be used to improve readability.

Aggregate names must not include underscore. Portfolio names may include underscore. Names can include a period, ``A.Basic.01``.

Dec Language Grammar Specification
===================================

Here is the full DecL Grammar and a `grammar railroad diagram <_static/diagram.xhtml>`_.

.. run python aggregate.parser.py to update this file

.. literalinclude:: 4_agg_language_reference/ref_include.rst

.. _test suite programs:

Test Suite Programs
===================

To run the test suite for HTML output, svg graphics.

.. code-block:: python

    from aggregate.extensions.test_suite import TestSuite
    TestSuite().run('^[A-KNO]', 'All Aggregate Tests', 'svg')


.. literalinclude:: ../aggregate/agg/test_suite.agg
   :language: agg


To only parse::

    from aggregate import build
    filename = build.default_dir / 'test_suite.agg'
    assert filename.exists()

    build.logger_level(30)
    df = build.interpreter_file(filename=filename)

    df.query('error != 0')


``sly`` Parser
==================

The parser is built using the ``sly`` package, https://sly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sly.html.
