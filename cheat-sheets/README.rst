Cheat Sheets (new July 2023)
=================================

I am working on a series of one-page cheat sheets for the major classes describing
all the methods and attributes. They provide a structured summary of
the capabilities of each object. They are available in the ``cheat-sheets``
directory. **DRAFT** PDF versions are available here:

* `Aggregate <Aggregate_Cheat_Sheet.pdf>`_
* `Portfolio <Portfolio_Cheat_Sheet.pdf>`_
* `Distributions <DecL_Cheat_Sheet.pdf>`_
* `Distributions <Distortion_Cheat_Sheet.pdf>`_
* `Underwriter <Underwriter_Cheat_Sheet.pdf>`_
* `Severity <Severity_Cheat_Sheet.pdf>`_
