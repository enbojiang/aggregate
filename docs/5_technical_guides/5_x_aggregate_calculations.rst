  * Bucket shift (vs. more complex methdods - KPW/LDA) - not a big deal
  * Sum to 1 (to normalize or not to normalize?) huge issue: can't cumsum for levs; convol messes up
  * Left tail right tail S vs F computation of diffs
  * Cum sum as approx to ?Simpson half h rule integrals

  See :ref:`FFT Convo <2_x_fft_convolution>`.
